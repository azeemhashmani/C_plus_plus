/*
 * Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted graph.
 * Advantage over Dijkstra's algorithm is that it can detect negative cycles in a graph.
 * Application : Used in RIP, Babel routing protocol
 * Time Complexiy : O(VxE) for one source and O(V^2 X E) for all vertices as source
 * Space Complexity : O(V)
